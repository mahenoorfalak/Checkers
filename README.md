# StateSearch-CheckersAI

## Project Description
This project implements a checkers game using state-based search algorithms and alpha-beta pruning to optimize decision-making.

## Features
- Implements the game of checkers
- Uses state search algorithms for move generation
- Alpha-beta pruning for optimal decision-making

## Note on Code Removal
This code was developed as part of an assignment, I have removed the starter code as per the instructor's guidelines. The removed code does not affect the core functionality of the project and was only intended to help get the project started.
