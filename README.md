# StateSearch-AI

## Project Description
This project implements a solver for a tile sliding puzzle that is a variant of the traditional **Hua Rong Dao** (or **Klotski**) puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the pieces into a specified goal configuration by sliding the pieces into blank spaces.
Unlike the traditional Hua Rong Dao puzzle, our variant allows for a board that is taller than 5 rows, and we have a fully specified goal state where the goal is not necessarily to move a 2x2 piece to the bottom center, as in the traditional puzzle.

## Features
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **A* Search** algorithms for solving the puzzle.
- FPuzzle board with a fixed width of 4 spaces and variable height.
- Multiple types of puzzle pieces, including 2x2, 1x2 (horizontal/vertical), and 1x1 pieces.

## Note on Code Removal
This code was developed as part of an assignment, I have removed the starter code as per the instructor's guidelines. The removed code does not affect the core functionality of the project and was only intended to help get the project started.
